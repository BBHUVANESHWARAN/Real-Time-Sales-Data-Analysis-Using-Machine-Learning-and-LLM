# **Real-Time Sales Data Analysis Using Machine Learning and LLMs**

## **Overview**

This project involves developing a sales analysis tool that integrates machine learning models with Large Language Models (LLMs). The system generates insights and interactive visualizations from real-time sales data to support data-driven decision-making.

## **Features**

- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict sales trends.
- **LLM Integration:** Incorporates Large Language Models for generating natural language summaries and insights.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Provides dynamic visualizations to explore and understand sales data effectively.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
- **LLM Frameworks:** Hugging Face Transformers
- **Visualization Tools:** Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas
- **Version Control:** Git

## **Usage**

1. **Run the application:** Execute the main script to start the sales analysis tool.
2. **Input Data:** Load real-time sales data into the system.
3. **Generate Insights:** Use the tool to obtain machine learning predictions and LLM-generated summaries.
4. **Explore Visualizations:** Interact with visualizations to analyze sales trends and patterns.

## **Dataset**

- The system works with real-time sales data and may require integration with data sources.
- Dataset details and instructions for data integration are available in the `data` directory.

## **Results**

- The tool delivers actionable insights and predictions from sales data, with interactive visualizations for effective analysis.
- Performance metrics and analysis results are available in the `results` directory.
